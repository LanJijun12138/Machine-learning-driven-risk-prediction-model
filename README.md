Model for Predicting ADL Disability Risk in Patients with Low Back Pain
This is a machine learning-based Streamlit web application for predicting ADL (Activities of Daily Living) disability risk in patients with low back pain.

Features
üéØ Intelligent Prediction: Predicts ADL disability risk based on SVM model
üìä Visual Explanation: Uses SHAP waterfall charts to explain prediction results
üåê English Interface: Fully English user interface
üì± Responsive Design: Supports access from various devices
üîç Feature Importance: Detailed display of each variable's impact on predictions

Output Result Interpretation
Prediction Category
0: No ADL disability risk
1: ADL disability risk exists
Risk Probability
Numerical value between 0-1, closer to 1 indicates higher risk
Displayed as percentage
SHAP Explanation Chart
Shows each feature's contribution to prediction results
Positive values: Increase risk
Negative values: Decrease risk
Larger absolute values indicate more significant impact
Important Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminder:

This tool provides data-driven estimates and cannot replace professional medical advice
The model is based on training data, and practical application requires clinical judgment
Age and number of hospitalizations are automatically standardized
All categorical variables are encoded as numerical values
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Dependency Package Installation Failure

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Port Occupied

streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
Insufficient Memory

Close other applications
Reduce SHAP background sample count (modify in code)
File Path Error

Ensure running in streamlit directory
Check if data and model folders exist
